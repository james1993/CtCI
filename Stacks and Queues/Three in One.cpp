/*
Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.

1. Divide the array into three equal parts and allow the individual stack to grow in that limited space.
2. Flexible stacks. When one stack exceeds its initial capacity, we grow the allowable capacity and shift elements as necessary.
